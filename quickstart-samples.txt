At the moment there is one sample and one test SLIC.  The test SLIC will 
eventually be used in automation testing, while no changes are currently
anticipated for the sample SLIC.  The instructions for each are essentially 
the same.
 
+==================
1) Every shell session

Correct the environment variables in this file to match your environment

	$ . ./${OPENMEAP_HOME}/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.sh
	
#==================
2) Publish the shared and slic-core projects to the local repository

The openmeap-shared and openmeap-slic-core project artifacts must be available within the local
ivy repository, in order to perform command-line builds for Android.

 $ . ./${OPENMEAP_HOME}/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.sh
 $ cd ./${OPENMEAP_HOME}/build-tools
 $ ant publish-local-shared
 $ ant publish-local-slic-core
	
+==================
3) The Banking sample

The Banking sample build script is setup to create an initial SLIC deployment
build and 3 versions to upload into the OpenMEAP Admin interface.

What you call them in the admin interface is up to you, but there must be a
version with the same identifier as appears in the client.properties file
(specifically, there must be a version 0.0.0a).  This requirement will change
in some update prior to the beta release of OpenMEAP.

The following command will 

 $ cd ${OPENMEAP_HOME}/samples/banking
	
The following will create the Android and iOS Banking sample clients
(only Android on non-Macs)
	
 $ ant create

The following will build the Android and iOS Banking sample clients
(only Android on non-Macs)	
	
 $ ant build
	
To create the 3 versions for uploading into /openmeap-admin-web/interface/
	
 $ ant package-versions
