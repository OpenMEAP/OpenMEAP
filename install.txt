 Setup Your Path and Environment Variables - Windows

 Set ANT_HOME

    Open System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
    Create a new system variable
    Variable name: ANT_HOME
    Variable value: e.g. C:\apache-ant
 
 Set JAVA_HOME

    Open System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables

    Open System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
    Create a new system variable
    Variable name: OPENMEAP_HOME
    Variable value: e.g. C:\OpenMEAP

 Open System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables

    Under system variables, edit PATH
    Add ;%ANT_HOME%\bin;%JAVA_HOME%\bin to the end of the PATH value 

 Verify that ANT and Java are installed

    Open your command-line tool and type ant -v and Java -version

 If you get errors, read the Ant and Java install guide.

 Setup Your Path & Environment Variables - Mac

 Set OpenMEAP Home Path

    export -x OPENMEAP_HOME=/Applications/OpenMEAP

 Add the new version of Ant to current terminal session

    export PATH=/usr/local/apache-ant/bin:"$PATH"

 Add the new version of Ant to future terminal sessions

    echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/apache-ant/bin:"$PATH"' >> ~/.profile

 Verify that ANT and Java are installed

    Open your command-line tool and type ant -v and java -version

=================================================================================

 Correct the environment variables in the setEnv file to match your environment

    OpenMEAP/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.bat - Windows
    OpenMEAP/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.sh - Mac

 Building the web projects

    $ cd OpenMEAP/build-tools
    $ %OPENMEAP_HOME%/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.bat - Windows
    $ . ~/OpenMEAP/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.sh - Mac
    $ ant dist-all-web
    $ ant publish-local-slic-core
	
 The openmeap-admin-web.war and openmeap-services-web.war files will be located 
 in /build-tools/dist. These will need to be dropped in Apache Tomcat's webapps 
 directory if you plan to deploy the OpenMEAP server in QA or Production.

=================================================================================

 Setup for creating and building clients - Using the installer

    cd OpenMEAP/slic
    edit the client.properties file to match your environment

 Setup for creating and building clients - Using the Github zip

    Create a slic folder
    Copy the OpenMEAP/build-tools/template/client.properties file to the slic folder
    Create an assets folder inside of the slic folder
    Copy the OpenMEAP/samples/banking/banking-app/original/ contents to the assets folder
    Edit the client.properties file to match your environment
 
 From your slic folder, set the environment variable

    $ %OPENMEAP_HOME%/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.bat - Windows
    $ . ~/Applications/OpenMEAP/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.sh - Mac

 Create and build your iOS project

    $ om_ios.sh create-project -propertyfile client.properties - Mac

 Create and build your windows phone project 

 Note: Please use the Windows project folder under clients/c/openmeap-slic-win to load 
       the Windows Phone Alpha Project.
 	
    $ om_win.bat create-project -propertyfile client.properties - Windows
 
 Create and build your android project 

    $ om_android.bat create-project -propertyfile client.properties - Windows
    $ om_android.sh create-project -propertyfile client.properties - Mac

 Note: if you want to create multiple apps, in your client.properties file, change 
 the name at the end of the naming convention. For example, com.openmeap to com.newappname.
 Once you have completed your changes to the client.properties file, save it as 
 client.properties.newappname. This way, when you want to build this client, you would 
 run these commands below to build for each platform.

 Mac:
    
    om_ios.sh create-project -propertyfile client.properties.newappname
    om_android.sh create-project -propertyfile client.properties.newappname

 Windows:
    
    om_win.bat create-project -propertyfile client.properties.newappname
    om_android.bat create-project -propertyfile client.properties.newappname
