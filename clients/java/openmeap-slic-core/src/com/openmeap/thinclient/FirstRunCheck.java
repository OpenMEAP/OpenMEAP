 * Dear Developer/Project Management,
 *
 * We've created this function to make a single hit to our tracking url
 * per unique install.  An effort has been made to make it secure and
 * non-reversible.  An effort has been made so that, even should it fail,
 * it only happens once.
 *
 * We're hoping you'll leave this code functional in your production 
 * release so that we can build-up value by tracking unique installs.
 *
 * Yours truly, OpenMEAP
