 Path & Environment Variables - Windowws

 Set ANT_HOME
     Open System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
     Create a new system variable
     Variable name: ANT_HOME
     Variable value: e.g. C:\apache-ant
 
 Set JAVA_HOME
     Open System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
     Create a new system variable
     Variable name: JAVA_HOME
     Variable value: e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_02

     Open System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
     Create a new system variable
     Variable name: OPENMEAP_HOME
     Variable value: e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenMEAP

 Open System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
     Under system variables, edit PATH
     Add ;%ANT_HOME%\bin;%JAVA_HOME%\bin to the end of the PATH value 

 Verify that ANT and Java are installed
     Open your command-line tool and type ant -v and Java -version

 If you get errors, read the Ant install guide. You may also need to copy the
 tools.jar file over from the JRE7/lib folder to your JDK/lib folder.

 Set OpenMEAP Home Path
    declare -x OPENMEAP_HOME=/Applications/OpenMEAP

 Verify that ANT and Java are installed
    Open your command-line tool and type ant -v and Java -version

=================================================================================

 Correct the environment variables in this file to match your environment

    OpenMEAP/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.bat - Windows
    OpenMEAP/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.sh - Mac

 Building the web projects

    $ cd OpenMEAP/build-tools
    $ %OPENMEAP_HOME%/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.bat - Windows
    $ . ~/OpenMEAP/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.sh - Mac
    $ ant dist-all-web
    $ ant publish-local-slic-core
	
 The openmeap-admin-web.war and openmeap-services-web.war files will be located 
 in /build-tools/dist. These need to be dropped in apache tomcat's webapps 
 directory if you plan to use the OpenMEAP server.

 Update the tomcat-users.xml in tomcat's conf directory with the info below

    <role rolename="openmeap-admin"/>
    <role rolename="openmeap-user"/>
    <user name="admin" password="openmeap" roles="tomcat,openmeap-user,openmeap-admin"/>
    <user name="user" password="openmeap" roles="openmeap-user"/>

=================================================================================

 Setup for creating and building clients - Using the installer

    cd OpenMEAP/slic
    edit the client.properties file to match your environment

 Setup for creating and building clients - Using the Github zip

    Create a slic folder
    Copy the OpenMEAP/build-tools/template/client.properties file to the slic folder
    Create an assets folder inside of the slice folder
    Copy the OpenMEAP/samples/banking/banking-app/original/ contents to the assets folder
    Edit the client.properties file to match your environment
 
 From your slice folder, set the environment variable

    %OPENMEAP_HOME%/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.bat - Windows
    $ . ~/Applications/OpenMEAP/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.sh - Mac

 Create and build your iOS project

    $ om_ios.sh create-project -propertyfile client.properties - Mac
 
 Create and build your android project 

    $ om_android.bat create-project -propertyfile client.properties - Windows
    $ om_android.sh create-project -propertyfile client.properties - Mac

 Create and build your BlackBerry project

    $ om_blackberry.bat create-project -propertyfile client.properties - Windows
    $ om_blackberry.sh create-project -propertyfile client.properties - Mac

 If you build BlackBerry on a Mac, you will need to update the client_blackberry.xml under OpenMEAP/build-tools/ant_scripts and change rapc.exe to rapc.jar 
	
=================================================================================

 Import OpenMEAP projects into Eclipse

    Disable to build automatically
    Open workspace preferences, expand general, select workspace
    De-select to build automatically 

 Import "build-tools" and configure the Ivy, Ant and Server settings for workshop

 Adding Ivy setting paths

    Open Eclipse "Preferences", expand Ivy, then Settings
    For "Ivy settings path", Click "Workspace..." and select ivysettings.xml under build-tools
    For "Property files", Click "Workspace..." and select ant.properties under build-tools 

 Setup the Ant properties
 
    Open workspace preferences, expand "Ant", select "Runtime"

    openmeap-slic-core, openmeap-slic-android
    openmeap-slic-blackberry (optional) 

 For BlackBerry, you must update your home source path in openmeap-slic-blackberry and point it to 
 the openmeap src folder. Include projects openmeap-shared, openmeap-shared-jdk5 and openmeap-slic-core 
 to the Java Build Path. 

 Add BlackBerry's external 
 
    JAR "Applications/eclipse/plugins/net.rim.ejde.componentpack5.0.0_5.0.0.36/components/lib/net_rim_api.jar"
