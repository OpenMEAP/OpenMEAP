OpenMEAP was created in xCode 4.2 Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers (w/ the IvyDE plugin)
http://www.eclipse.org/
http://ant.apache.org/ivy/ivyde/

OpenMEAP web projects have been tested on Apache Tomcat 5.5, 6.0 and 7.0
http://tomcat.apache.org/

OpenMEAP command-line requires Apache Ant 1.8 or greater.
http://ant.apache.org/


+==================
1) Every shell session

Correct the environment variables in this file to match your environment
(setEnv.bat file if running in Windows)

	$ . ./${OPENMEAP_HOME}/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.sh

+==================
2) Building the web projects
	
Build the web projects (only need to do this once)
Builds openmeap-admin-web.war and openmeap-services-web.war
These can be dropped in apache tomcat's webapps directory

You'll need to login to /openmeap-admin-web/interface/ 
with a user who has the two roles openmeap-admin and openmeap-user
so, you'll need to update the tomcat-users.xml in tomcat's conf directory

	$ cd ${OPENMEAP_HOME}/build-tools
	$ ant dist-all-web
	
The resulting artifacts will end up in ${OPENMEAP_HOME}/build-tools/dist

+==================
3) Creating and building clients
	
Create an arbitrarily located/named directory for new SLICs

	$ mkdir ~/om_slic
	$ cd ~/om_slic

Copy over the client.properties template provided

	om_slic $ cp $OPENMEAP_HOME/build-tools/template/client.properties .

Correct the properties to match your environment

	om_slic $ vi client.properties
	
Create the assets folder (whatever you updated client.properties with)
and copy in the openmeap.js

	om_slic $ mkdir assets
	om_slic $ cd assets
	assets $ cp ${OPENMEAP_HOME}/clients/shared/javascript/openmeap.js .
	
Create DHTML application

	assets $ vi index.html
	...
	assets $ cd .. 

List what you can do (illustrative, here, only)

	om_slic $ om_android.sh -p
	om_slic $ om_blackberry.sh -p
	om_slic $ om_ios.sh -p
	
Publish the shared and slic-core projects to the local repository.
The openmeap-shared and openmeap-slic-core project artifacts must be available
within the local ivy repository, in order to perform command-line builds for 
Android.  This step only needs to be performed when these projects have 
changed.

	$ . ./${OPENMEAP_HOME}/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.sh
	$ cd ./${OPENMEAP_HOME}/build-tools
	$ ant publish-local-shared
	$ ant publish-local-shared-jdk5
	$ ant publish-local-slic-core

Create and build your iOS project.  Opens and runs in xCode 4.2

	om_slic $ om_ios.sh create-project -propertyfile client.properties
	om_slic $ om_ios.sh build-debug -propertyfile client.properties

Create and build your android project.  Install to a device using adb
See the android docs for how to do this.  The build.xml in the android
SLIC directory is what was created by the android sdk.

	om_slic $ om_android.sh create-project -propertyfile client.properties
	om_slic $ om_android.sh build-debug -propertyfile client.properties

Create and build your BlackBerry project

	om_slic $ om_blackberry.sh create-project -propertyfile client.properties
	om_slic $ om_blackberry.sh build-debug -propertyfile client.properties

+==================	
*) Import Android SLIC projects into Eclipse

In order to import an Android project into into Eclipse,
you must first make sure to import the openmeap-shared, openmeap-shared-jdk5, openmeap-slic-core, 
and openmeap-slic-android projects into the target workspace.

Because you must import these, you must also specify the openmeap.home and android.sdk.home 
ant properties as mentioned in the quickstart-eclipse.txt
file.

Next you must choose you must create a New Android project, 
then select to create from existing source.  The source root
must be whereever you directed the command-line script to create
the SLIC.
 
+==================	
*) Import Blackberry SLIC projects into Eclipse

In order to import an Blackberry project into into Eclipse,
you must first make sure to import the openmeap-shared, openmeap-slic-core,
and openmeap-slic-blackberry projects into the target workspace.

Because you must import these, you must also specify the openmeap.home 
and blackberry.sdk.home ant properties as mentioned in the quickstart-eclipse.txt
file.

Next you must choose you must create a New Blackberry project, 
then select to create from existing source.  The source root
must be whereever you directed the command-line script to create
the SLIC.

Next, you'll need to do this for the openmeap-slic-blackberry project too,
create 3 "Build Path"->"Link Source" folders.  The first time, click "Variables" and
create OPENMEAP_HOME.  Then select OPENMEAP_HOME and click "Extend...".
The first time, select java-shared/openmeap-shared/src and then rename
the "Folder Name" to "openmeap-shared".  Do the same for
clients/java/openmeap-slic-core and clients/java/openmeap-slic-blackberry.

The final step is to correct the "JRE System Library" library in the project.
Just right-click, select properties, and select the 5.0.0 Blackberry runtime
from the "Alternate JRE:" drop-down.
