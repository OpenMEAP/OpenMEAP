 Path & Environment Variables - Windows

 Set ANT_HOME
     Open System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
     Create a new system variable
     Variable name: ANT_HOME
     Variable value: e.g. C:\apache-ant
 
 Set JAVA_HOME
     Open System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
     Create a new system variable
     Variable name: JAVA_HOME
     Variable value: e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_02

 Set OPENMEAP_HOME
     Open System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
     Create a new system variable
     Variable name: OPENMEAP_HOME
     Variable value: e.g. C:\OpenMEAP

 Open System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
     Under system variables, edit PATH
     Add ;%ANT_HOME%\bin;%JAVA_HOME%\bin to the end of the PATH value 

 Verify that ANT and Java are installed
     Open your command-line tool and type ant -v and Java -version

 If you get errors, read the Ant install guide. You may also need to copy the
 tools.jar file over from the JRE7/lib folder to your JDK/lib folder. 

 Path & Environment Variables - Mac

 Set OpenMEAP Home Path
    declare -x OPENMEAP_HOME=/Applications/OpenMEAP

 Verify that ANT and Java are installed
    Open your command-line tool and type ant -v and Java -version

=================================================================================

 Correct the environment variables in this file to match your environment

    OpenMEAP/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.bat - Windows
    OpenMEAP/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.sh - Mac

 Building the web projects

    $ cd OpenMEAP/build-tools
    $ %OPENMEAP_HOME%/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.bat - Windows
    $ . ~/OpenMEAP/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.sh - Mac
    $ ant dist-all-web
    $ ant publish-local-slic-core
	
 The openmeap-admin-web.war and openmeap-services-web.war files will be located 
 in /build-tools/dist. These need to be dropped in apache tomcat's webapps 
 directory if you plan to use the OpenMEAP server.

 Update the tomcat-users.xml in tomcat's conf directory with the info below

    <role rolename="openmeap-admin"/>
    <role rolename="openmeap-user"/>
    <user name="admin" password="openmeap" roles="tomcat,openmeap-user,openmeap-admin"/>
    <user name="user" password="openmeap" roles="openmeap-user"/>

=================================================================================

 Setup for creating and building clients - Using the installer

    cd OpenMEAP/slic
    edit the client.properties file to match your environment

 Setup for creating and building clients - Using the Github zip

    Create a slic folder
    Copy the OpenMEAP/build-tools/template/client.properties file to the slic folder
    Create an assets folder inside of the slice folder
    Copy the OpenMEAP/samples/banking/banking-app/original/ contents to the assets folder
    Edit the client.properties file to match your environment
 
 From your slic folder, set the environment variable

    %OPENMEAP_HOME%/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.bat - Windows
    $ . ~/Applications/OpenMEAP/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.sh - Mac

 Create and build your iOS project

    $ om_ios.sh create-project -propertyfile client.properties - Mac

 Create and build your windows phone project 

    $ om_win.bat create-project -propertyfile client.properties - Windows
 
 Create and build your android project 

    $ om_android.bat create-project -propertyfile client.properties - Windows
    $ om_android.sh create-project -propertyfile client.properties - Mac

Note: if you want to create multiple apps, in your client.properties file, change 
the name at the end of the naming convention. For example, com.openmeap to com.newappname.
Once you have completed your changes to the client.properties file, save it as 
client.properties.newappname. This way, when you want to build this client, you would 
run these commands below to build for each platform.

Mac:

om_ios.sh create-project -propertyfile client.properties.newappname
om_android.sh create-project -propertyfile client.properties.newappname

Windows:

om_win.bat create-project -propertyfile client.properties.newappname
om_android.bat create-project -propertyfile client.properties.newappname
